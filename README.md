To support document retrieval in Bahasa Indonesia, we are making available a Porter stemmer for the language, a stop word list, as well as two document collections, together with topics and qrels for those topics: the Kompas online collection and the Tempo online collection.

Details about the development of those resources and their usage for evaluation purposes can be found in the following publications:
